scan buffer (solid fill)
    y-axis x-axis min x-axis max
    y:0, min:2, max:6
    y:1, min:1, max:7
    y:2, min:0, max:8

2d-simplex: triangle
    flat in 3d space
    how to convert a triangle into a scan buffer?
    #7 rewatch, reimplement

[ ]what broke the game? test your debugging skills! -----
    - transformation when moving camera
        - debug shows it works
        - matrix multiplication maybe?
    - not quaternion, rotations work
    - could be perspective projection matrix
        - vertices after mvp transformation say they are invisible
            not moved so must be matrix issues
        - could be vector w: 1 component
[ ]understand the gradient formula
    - it's a slope, X and Y diffs, steps
[ ]understand clip space
    [x]fix weird corner clip error
        - when all vertices are out of the screen but still need to be clipped
[ ]understand perspective projection (x,y movements)
    [ ]clean up starfield
[ ]understand matrix look-at function
[ ]understand how the triangles clipped on the corners
[ ]remove pub in unnecessary places
[ ]fix camera movements
    [ ]improve passed enums
[ ]remove commented code
[ ]remove main.cpp and references
[ ]add some scenery models
[ ]speed up mesh loader
[ ]pass light direction to gradients
[ ]more debug variables in renderer
[ ]implement shadow mapping
