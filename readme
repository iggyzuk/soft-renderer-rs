2d-simplex: triangle
    flat in 3d space
    how to convert a triangle into a scan buffer?
    #7 rewatch, reimplement

[~]understand the gradient formula
    - it's a slope, X and Y diffs, steps
[~]understand matrix look-at function
[x]understand how the triangles clipped on the corners
[ ]bitmap with various format f32 too for bitmap of depth or a u32 (4 bytes)
[ ]create rasterize.rs
[ ]remove pub in unnecessary places
[ ]fix camera movements
    [ ]improve passed enums
[ ]remove commented code
[x]add some scenery models
[ ]speed up mesh loader
[ ]pass light direction to gradients
[ ]more debug variables in renderer
    [ ]egui: from ref
    [ ]remove main.cpp and references
[x]implement shadow mapping
